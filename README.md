# [Personal website](https://matteobettini.com)

My personal website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [wowchemy academic theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic).

A GitHub workflow automatically builds the website from the [professional_website](https://github.com/matteobettini/professional_website) repository and deploys it here. 

The site is available at **[matteobettini.com](https://matteobettini.com)**
